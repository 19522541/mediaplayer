00:00:14‚303 --> 00:00:17‚602
I can see you standing honey

2
00:00:17‚706 --> 00:00:20‚905
With his arms around your body

3
00:00:21‚007 --> 00:00:25‚306
Laughin′ but the joke′s
not funny at all

4
00:00:28‚008 --> 00:00:30‚907
And it took you five whole minutes

5
00:00:31‚005 --> 00:00:34‚304
To pack us up and leave me with it

6
00:00:34‚408 --> 00:00:38‚207
Holdin all this love out
here in the hall

7
00:00:41‚015 --> 00:00:44‚914

8
00:00:45‚412 --> 00:00:47‚511
And I didn′t like the ending

9
00:00:47‚607 --> 00:00:51‚506
You are not my homeland anymore

10
00:00:52‚114 --> 00:00:54‚563

16
00:01:34‚102 --> 00:01:37‚001
Second third and hundredth chances

17
00:01:37‚111 --> 00:01:40‚310
Balancin on breaking branches

18
00:01:40‚414 --> 00:01:44‚813
Those eyes add insult to injury

19
00:01:47‚215 --> 00:01:51‚214

20
00:01:51‚312 --> 00:01:53‚711
